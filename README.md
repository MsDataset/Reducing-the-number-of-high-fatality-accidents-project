# Reducing-the-number-of-high-fatality-accidents-project
### This repository contains the exploratory data analysis I carried out using the road safety dataset provided in the competition column on Datacamp. 
In this project, I carried out exploratory statistical and data analysis using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matploitlib and seaborn to understand the characteristics of major accidents in Ariona, UK. 
The aim of the project is to help the safety team identify interventions and proffer recommendations that can that can lower the number of casualties and deaths resulting from road accidents, helping the road safety team to make informed decisions and take proactive measures.
