# Reducing-the-number-of-high-fatality-accidents-project
###  In this project, I carried out exploratory statistical and data analysis using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matploitlib and seaborn to understand the characteristics of major accidents in Ariona. This is to help the safety team identify interventions and proffer recommendations that can that can lower the number of casualties and deaths resulting from road accidents, helping the road safety team to make informed decisions and take proactive measures.
